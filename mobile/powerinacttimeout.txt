! U1 setvar "power.inactivity_timeout" "1200"
! U1 do "device.reset" "" 

This would set the Inactivity Timeout to 1200 seconds.
 A lot of environments require that the printer never power down
(this will consume more battery power),the command for this is below:

! U1 setvar "power.inactivity_timeout" "0"
! U1 do "device.reset" ""
